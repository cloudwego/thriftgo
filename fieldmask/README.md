# Thrift FieldMask RFC

## What is thrift fieldmask?
FieldMask is inspired by [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#field-mask) and used to indicates the data that users care about, and filter out useless data, during a RPC call, in order to reducing network package size and accelerating serializing/deserializing process. This tech has been widely used among Protobuf [services](https://netflixtechblog.com/practical-api-design-at-netflix-part-1-using-protobuf-fieldmask-35cfdc606518).

## How to construct a fieldmask?
To construct a fieldmask, you need two things: 
 - [Thrift Path](#thrift-path) for describing the data you want
 - [Type Descriptor](#type-descriptor) for validating the thrift path you pass is compatible with thrift message definition (IDL)

### Thrift Path

#### What is thrift path?
A path string represents a arbitrary endpoint of thrift object. It is used for locating data from thrift root message, and defined from-top-to-bottom.
For exapmle, a thrift message defined as below:
```thrift
struct Example {
    1: string Foo,
    2: i64 Bar
    3: Example Self
}
```
A thrift path `$.Foo` represents the string value of Example.Foo, and `$.Self.Bar` represents the secondary layer i64 value of Example.Self.Bar
Since thrift has four nesting types (LIST/SET/MAP/STRUCT), thrift path should also support locating elements in all these types' object, not only STRUCT.

#### Syntax
Here are basic hypothesis:
- `fieldname` is the field name of a field in a struct, it **MUST ONLY** contain '[a-zA-Z]' alphabet letters, integer numbers and char '_'.
- `index` is the index of a element in a list or set, it **MUST ONLY** contain integer numbers.
- `key` is the string-typed key of a element in a map, it can contain any letters, but it **MUST** be a quoted string.
- `id` is the integer-typed key of a element in a map, it **MUST ONLY** contain integer numbers.
- except `key`, ThriftPath shouldn't contains any blank chars (\n\r\b\t).

Here is detailed syntax:

ThriftPath | Description
-- | --
$ | the root object,every path must start with it.
.`fieldname` | get the child field of a struct corepsonding to fieldname. For example, `$.FieldA.ChildrenB`
[`index`,`index`...] | get any number of elements in an List/Set corepsonding to indices. Indices must be integer.For example: `$.FieldList[1,3,4]` .Notice: a index beyond actual list size can written but is useless.
{"`key`","`key`"...} | get any number of values corepsonding to key in a string-typed-key map. For example: `$.StrMap{"abcd","1234"}` 
{`id`,`id`...} | get the child field with specific id in a integer-typed-key map. For example, `$.IntMap{1,2}` 
\* | get **ALL** fields/elements, that is: `$.StrMap{*}.FieldX` menas gets all the elements' FieldX in a map Root.StrMap; `$.List[*].FieldX` means get all the elements' FieldX in a list Root.List. 
</byte-sheet-html-origin><!--EndFragment-->

#### Agreement Of Implementation
- A empty mask means "PASS ALL" (all field is "PASS")
- For map of neither-string-nor-integer typed key, only syntax token of all '*' (see above) is allowed in.
- For safty, required fields which are not in mask ("Filtered") will still be written into message:
  - by default, write **current value** of the required field;
  - add generate option `field_mask_zero_required`: write **zero value** of the required field
- FieldMask settings must start from the root object.
  - Tips: If you want to set FieldMask from a non-root object and make it effective, you need to add `field_mask_halfway` option and regenerate the codes. However, there is a latent risk: if different parent objects reference the same child object, and these two parent objects set different fieldmasks, only one parent object's fieldmask relative to this child object will be effective.

#### Visibility
By default, a field in mask means "PASS" (**will be** serialized/deserialized),  and the other fields not in mask means "REJECT" (**won't be** serialized/deserialized) -- which is so-called **"White List"**
However, we allow user to use fieldmask as a **"Black List"**, as long as enable option `Options.BlackList` mode. Under such mode, a field in the mask means "REJECT", and the other fields means "PASS". See [main_test.go](https://github.com/cloudwego/kitex-tests/blob/feat/fieldmask_test/thriftrpc/fieldmask/main_test.go) for detailed usage.

### Type Descriptor
Type descriptor is the runtime representation of a message definition, in aligned with [Protobuf Descriptor](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto). To get a type descriptor, you must enable thrift reflection feature first, which was introduced in thriftgo [v0.3.0](https://github.com/cloudwego/thriftgo/pull/83). you can generate related codes for this feature using option `with_reflection`.

## How to use fieldmask?
1. First, you must generates codes for this feature using two options `with_fieldmask` and `with_reflection`
```
$ thriftgo -g with_field_mask,with_reflection ${your_idl}
```
2. Create a fieldmask in the initializing phase of your application (recommanded), or just in the bizhandler before you return a response
```go
import (
	"sync"
	"github.com/cloudwego/thriftgo/fieldmask"
	nbase "github.com/cloudwego/thriftgo/test/golang/fieldmask/gen-new/base"
)

var fieldmaskCache sync.Map

func init() {
	// new a obj to get its TypeDescriptor
	obj := nbase.NewBase()
    desc := obj.GetTypeDescriptor()

	// construct a fieldmask with TypeDescriptor and thrift pathes
	fm, err := fieldmask.NewFieldMask(desc,
		"$.Addr", "$.LogID", "$.TrafficEnv.Code", "$.Meta.IntMap{1}", "$.Meta.StrMap{\"1234\"}", "$.Meta.List[1]", "$.Meta.Set[1]")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// cache it for future usage of nbase.Base
	fieldmaskCache.Store("Mask1ForBase", fm)
}
```
  - If you want to enable black-list mode of fieldmask, you can create fieldmask like this:
```go
    fm, err := fieldmask.Options{
        BlackListMode: true,
    }.NewFieldMask(desc, "$.Addr")
```

3. Now you can use fieldmask in either client-side or server-side
  - For server-side, you can set fieldmask with generated API `Set_FieldMask()` on your response object. Then the object itself will notice the fieldmask and using it during its serialization
  ```go
  func bizHandler(req any) (*nbase.Base) {
    // handle request ...

	// biz logic: handle and get final response object
	obj := bizBase()

	// Load fieldmask from cache
	fm, _ := fieldmaskCache.Load("Mask1ForBase")
	if fm != nil {
		// load ok, set fieldmask onto the object using codegen API
		obj.Set_FieldMask(fm.(*fieldmask.FieldMask))
	}

	return obj
  }
  ```
  - For client-side: related to the deserialization process of framework. For kitex, it's WIP.


## How to pass fieldmask between programs?
Generally, you can add one binary field on your request definition to carry fieldmask, and explicitly serialize/deserialize the fieldmask you are using into/from this field. We provide two encapsulated API for serialization/deserialization:
- [FieldMask.MarshalJSON()/UnmarshalJSON()](serdes.go): Object methods, serialize/deserialize fieldmask into/from json bytes
- [thriftgo/fieldmask.Marshal()/Unmarshal()](serdes.go): Package functions, serialize/deserialize fieldmask into/from binary bytes. We recommand you to use this API rather than the last one, because it is **much faster** due to using cache -- Unless your application is lack of memory.
